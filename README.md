# DictDeque
A dict-based deque, whose performance for enqueueing and dequeueing from either end is O(1), regardless of deque size.
This module also includes functions palindromeDequeCheck and findPalindromes, that utlize deques to determine whether a
string is a palindrome and create a dictionary of palindrome:count key:value pairs from a project gutenberg book, respectively.
